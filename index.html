						<h1>Rishab's Analytics Portfolio<br />
						</h1>
						<p>Hi, I'm Rishab, an aspiring analyst with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and currently pursuing a Post Graduation in Business Analytics. I’m excited to build a career as an analyst, and I have a strong background in SQL, Excel, Python, Tableau, PowerBI, Machine Learning, and Statistics. Through my projects, I've developed the skills to extract valuable insights from data and help drive decisions.

							Before focusing on analytics, I worked as a Software Engineer in the Automation Testing Team at Tech Mahindra, where I gained solid experience in automation and problem-solving. I’m passionate about using data to improve business outcomes and make informed decisions.
							
							In addition to technical skills, I have developed strong communication, problem-solving, and critical thinking abilities that are essential for any analyst role. I am adept at understanding business needs, creating requirements documents,  stakeholder communication, and using data to recommend actionable strategies. I also have experience in process optimization and project management, ensuring that business objectives are met efficiently.
							
							In my free time, I enjoy playing cricket, traveling, exploring new places, talking to people, and expanding my network. I’m always open to learning, growing, and connecting with others.
							
							Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or learn more about my work! </p>

									<h2><a>Adventure Works Bike Shop Power BI Project<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>In the AdventureWorks Power BI project, I applied data preparation, modeling, and visualization techniques to simulate real-world tasks. Using Power Query, I connected to data sources, transformed data, and built a relational data model. I utilized DAX to create calculated fields and performed advanced data analysis, including time-based calculations. Interactive reports and dashboards were designed to visualize key metrics, trends, and business insights. This project demonstrates my ability to work with Power BI, Power Query, and DAX to create actionable insights from data.</p>

									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images\Data Professional.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The Data Professional Survey Dashboard provides insights into key factors affecting data professionals, including happiness linked to salary and work-life balance, geographic distribution, and industry representation. Visualizations include a treemap showing most respondents are from the U.S., a stacked bar chart highlighting Data Scientists as the highest earners (averaging nearly $100k), and a donut chart breaking down industry representation. Programming language preferences are showcased in a stacked column chart, while a gauge chart measures happiness levels. Post data cleaning, the analysis focuses on 274 professionals, summarizing metrics like respondent count and averages in card labels.</p>

										<h2><a>Web Scraping and Regression Project Using Python<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images\WebScraping.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project, I created a dataset by scraping data from a webpage over a period of six years, from January 1st, 2018, to December 31st, 2023. The dataset included daily data points such as date, price, likes, dislikes, and followers, which were extracted by parsing the website with a dynamically changing URL. After gathering the data, I cleaned and preprocessed it to ensure accuracy, then saved it as a CSV file for further analysis. I applied regression techniques to predict the price of the product on January 1st, 2024, selecting the algorithm with the lowest RMSE to ensure the most accurate forecast. This project combined web scraping, data cleaning, and machine learning to deliver a predictive model based on historical data.</p>
